         <blockquote>
           <p><span class="STYLE18"> 1）Group-oriented services such as group recommendations aim to provide services for a group of users. For these applications, how to aggregate the preferences of diﬀerent group members is the toughest yet most important problem.</span></p>
           <p><span class="STYLE18">2）In traditional preference aggregation methods, such as <em>prefernce aggregation and score aggregation</em>,  the interactions and fairness of group members are still largely ignored.</span> <span class="STYLE18">Therefore, these aggregation approaches, which are unable to figure out the optimal selections that can be accepted by all members in a group, may lead to unsatisfying services.</span> </p>
           <p><span class="STYLE18">3)Inspired by game theory, we propose to explore the idea of Nash equilibrium to simulate the selections of members in a group by a game process. Game process could capture the group members’ interactions and Nash equilibrium solution considers the fairness as much as possible.</span></p>
           <p><span class="STYLE18">4)Along this line, we ﬁrst calculate the preferences (group-dependent optimal selections) of each individual member in a given group scene, i.e., an equilibrium solution of this group, with the help of two pruning approaches. Then, to get the aggregated unitary preference of each group from all group members, we design a matrix factorizationbased method which aggregates the preferences in latent space and estimates the ﬁnal group preference in rating space. After obtaining the group preference, group-oriented services (e.g., group recommendation) can be directly provided. </span></p>

           <p><span class="STYLE16"><span class="STYLE20"><span class="STYLE18">Repeated crowdsourcing system refers to the crowdsourcing systems with tasks which need to be conducted several times. A problem needs to be solved in repeated crowdsourcing system is how to set appropriate incentives for task receivers to maximize the profits of task givers and task receivers.</span></span></span></p>
           <p><span class="STYLE16"><span class="STYLE20"><span class="STYLE18"><br />
             I build the discrete model of repeated crowdsourcing system and calculate the profits of task givers and task receivers in each round under different ways of pay, different productive functions and different incentives. Then the following conclusions can be drawn: <br />
             1. In discrete model of repeated crowdsourcing system, if incentives are limited, then the cumulative profits of task givers and task receivers are limited. <br />
             2. In low-pay discrete model of crowdsourcing system, the cumulative profits of task givers are increasing with tthe number of turns. <br />
             3. The monotonicity of the cumulative profits of task receivers are related to the relative strength of different incentives and the initial profits of task receivers. </span></span></span></p>
           <p class="STYLE18">From this work, the mediation platforms can design a pricipal scheme to incentivize the participation of both task givers and task receivers. (future work) </p>

         <p class="STYLE18">1.Risk Finance Paradigm with Copulas</p>
         <blockquote class="STYLE18">
           <p class="STYLE18">1) When facing with risks, companies can choose to pool, hedge or avoid them. However, the traditional risk finance paradigm can't give a quantitative method to describe the condition of the application of these strategies. </p>
           <p class="STYLE18">2) In our prior work (<em>Risk Finance for Catastrophe Losses with Pareto-Calibrated Levy-Stable Severities, Michael R. Powers</em>), we used stable distribution to model this paradigm. In this paradigm, we assume that losses are independent, which is inconsistent with our real experience. </p>
           <p><span class="STYLE16"> If we assume losses are correlated, the paradigm would be different. The reason for taking correlation into consideration is that correlation between losses will affect people’s decision about whether to hedge or pool the loss portfolio L. For example, a group of marine traders want to limit their ship sinking risks. If their routes are different, their ship sinking risks are uncorrelated and they can divide their merchandise into portions and distribute across all ships (pooling), then no trader will be devastated by sinking of one ship. However if their routes are the same, their ship sinking risks are correlated (their ships may be attacked by hurricane or tidal wave together), then pooling will be useless in this case because they will be devastated by sinking of ship altogether and they should choose to hedge this portfolio like to buy insurance from an insurer (who can afford this because he can pool the risks from different marine trader groups).</span></p>
           <p><span class="STYLE16">3) Heavy-tailed case: As p increases, the firm will be more sensitive to risks, and the lower boundary will decreases more rapidly as the expected frequency increases. It can be observed that when p &lt; 2, a firm will still choose pooling when the dependence between risks is small as the expected frequency increases. However, when p &gt; 2, as the expected frequency is large enough, the firm will always choose hedging no matter the dependence is small or not.<br />
           </span><img src="pic/risk1.JPG" width="459" height="303" /><img src="pic/risk2.JPG" width="431" height="306" /></p>
           <p>4) Light-tailed case:</p>
           <p>When the expected frequency become a little larger, the firm will be able to accept higher dependence(TypeII). It may be attributed to that a little larger frequency offers more choice for the firm to distribute the risks. </p>
           <p>When the expected frequency achieves some point, the firm can only accept lower dependence as the expected frequency increases(TypeI). It may be attributed to that higher frequency will increase a firms’ overall risks to a large extent. And an interesting inverse lower part appears(TypeIII). In this part, the firm will be exposed to high frequency and low dependence risks, and it will choose hedging to diminish the risks brought by the high frequency.</p>
           <p>As p increases, the firm will be more sensitive to risks, and the lower part of the T ypeI boundary will decreases more rapidly as the expected frequency increases. When p &gt; 4/3, the hedging districts in the right-upper corner and in the right-lower corner will merge when the expected frequency is large enough, which means that the firm will always choose hedging when the expected frequency is large enough. When p &lt; 4/3, there will always be a room left for pooling no matter how larger the expected frequency will be.</p>
