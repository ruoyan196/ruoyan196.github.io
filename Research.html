         <blockquote>
           <p><span class="STYLE18"> Group-oriented services such as group recommendations aim to provide services for a group of users. For these applications, how to aggregate the preferences of diﬀerent group members is the toughest yet most important problem. Inspired by game theory, we propose to explore the idea of Nash equilibrium to simulate the selections of members in a group by a game process. Along this line, we ﬁrst calculate the preferences (group-dependent optimal selections) of each individual member in a given group scene, i.e., an equilibrium solution of this group, with the help of two pruning approaches. Then, to get the aggregated unitary preference of each group from all group members, we design a matrix factorizationbased method which aggregates the preferences in latent space and estimates the ﬁnal group preference in rating space. After obtaining the group preference, group-oriented services (e.g., group recommendation) can be directly provided. </span></p>

         <blockquote>
           <p><span class="STYLE16"><span class="STYLE20"><span class="STYLE18">Repeated crowdsourcing system refers to the systems with tasks which need to be conducted several times. A problem needs to be solved in repeated crowdsourcing system is how to set appropriate incentives for task receivers to maximize the profits of task givers and task receivers.<br />
           I build the discrete model of repeated crowdsourcing system and calculate the profits of task givers and task receivers in each round under different ways of pay, different productive functions and different incentives. I could draw the following conclusions: <br />
             1. In discrete model of repeated crowdsourcing system, if incentives are limited, then the cumulative profits of task givers and task receivers are limited. <br />
             2. In low-pay discrete model of crowdsourcing system, the cumulative profits of task givers are increasing. <br />
             3. The monotonicity of the cumulative profits of task receivers are related to the relative strength of different incentives and the initial profits of task receivers. </span></span></span></p>

         <blockquote>
           <p><span class="STYLE16"><span class="STYLE18"> We assume losses are correlated. The reason for taking correlation into consideration is that correlation between losses will affect people’s decision about whether to hedge or pool the loss portfolio L. For example, a group of marine traders want to limit their ship sinking risks. If their routes are different, their ship sinking risks are uncorrelated and they can divide their merchandise into portions and distribute across all ships (pooling), then no trader will be devastated by sinking of one ship. However if their routes are<br />
             the same, their ship sinking risks are correlated (their ships may be attacked by hurricane or tidal wave together), then pooling will be useless in this case because they will be devastated by sinking of ship altogether and they should choose to hedge this portfolio like to buy insurance from an insurer (who can afford this because he can pool the risks from different marine trader groups).<br />
