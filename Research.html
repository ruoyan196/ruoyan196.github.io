         <blockquote>
           <p class="STYLE18">1）Group-oriented services such as group recommendations aim to provide services for a group of users. For these applications, how to aggregate the preferences of diﬀerent group members is the toughest yet most important problem.</p>
           <p class="STYLE18">2）In traditional preference aggregation methods, such as preference aggregation and score aggregation, the interactions and fairness of group members are still largely ignored. Therefore, these aggregation approaches, which are unable to figure out the optimal selections that can be accepted by all members of a group, may lead to unsatisfying services. </p>
           <p class="STYLE18">3)Inspired by game theory, we propose to explore the idea of Nash equilibrium to simulate the selections of members in a group by a game process. The game process could capture the group members’ interactions and Nash equilibrium solution considers the fairness as much as possible.</p>
           <p class="STYLE18">4)Along with this line, we ﬁrst calculate the preferences (group-dependent optimal selections) of each individual member in a given group scene, i.e., an equilibrium solution of this group, with the help of two pruning approaches. Then, to get the aggregated unitary preference of each group from all group members, we design a matrix factorization-based method which aggregates the preferences in latent space and estimates the ﬁnal group preference in rating space. After obtaining the group preference, group-oriented services (e.g., group recommendation) can be directly provided. </p>

             3）– Proved that when the anchoring effect coefﬁcient r of requesters is smaller than 1, the cumulative proﬁts of requesters will converge to a certain value increasingly, and the value is negatively correlated with r (which means a better strategy for requesters is to increase the wage slowly).</p>
           <p class="STYLE18"> – Proved that when the anchoring effect coefﬁcient P of requesters is smaller than 1 and r P, the cumulative proﬁts of workers will converge to a certain value increasingly, and the value is negatively correlated with P (which means a better strategy for workers is to increase the effort slowly but than the reaction of requester), otherwise, the workers should leave the game.</p>
           <p class="STYLE18">4) The crowdsourcing platforms can use this model to design a principal scheme to incentivize the participation of both requesters and workers.</p>

         <p class="STYLE18">1.Risk Finance Strategy Paradigm with Copulas</p>
         <blockquote class="STYLE18">
           <p>1) When dealing with risks, companies can choose to pool, hedge or avoid them. However, the traditional risk finance paradigm can't give a quantitative method to describe the condition of the application of these strategies. </p>
           <p>2) In our prior work (Risk Finance for Catastrophe Losses with Pareto-Calibrated Levy-Stable Severities, Michael R. Powers), we used stable distribution to model this paradigm. In this paradigm, we assume that losses are independent, which is inconsistent with our real experience. </p>
           <p>If we assume losses are correlated, the paradigm would be different. The reason for taking correlation into consideration is that correlation between losses will affect people’s decision about whether to hedge or pool the loss portfolio L. For example, a group of marine traders wants to limit their ship sinking risks. If their routes are different, their ship sinking risks are uncorrelated and they can divide their merchandise into portions and distribute across all ships (pooling), then no trader will be devastated by a sinking of one ship. However if their routes are the same, their ship sinking risks are correlated (their ships may be attacked by hurricane or tidal wave together), then pooling will be useless in this case because they will be devastated by a sinking of ship altogether and they should choose to hedge this portfolio like to buy insurance from an insurer (who can afford this because he can pool the risks from different marine trader groups).</p>
           <p>3) We also  designed a parallel-serial numerical algorithm to get Fourier-analytic risks for levy-stable variables. </p>
           <p>4) Heavy-tailed case: As p increases, the firm will be more sensitive to risks, and the lower boundary will decreases more rapidly as the expected frequency increases. It can be observed that when p &lt; 2, a firm will still choose to pool when the dependence between risks is small as the expected frequency increases. However, when p &gt; 2, as the expected frequency is large enough, the firm will always choose to hedge no matter the dependence is small or not.</p>
           <p class="STYLE18"><span class="STYLE16"><br />
           </span><img src="pic/risk1.JPG" width="459" height="303" /><img src="pic/risk2.JPG" width="431" height="306" /></p>
           <p>5) Light-tailed case:</p>
           <p>When the expected frequency become a little larger, the firm will be able to accept higher dependence(TypeII). It may be attributed to that a little larger frequency offers more choice for the firm to distribute the risks. </p>
           <p>When the expected frequency achieves some point, the firm can only accept lower dependence as the expected frequency increases(TypeI). It may be attributed to that higher frequency will increase a firms’ overall risks to a large extent. And an interesting inverse lower part appears(TypeIII). In this part, the firm will be exposed to high frequency and low dependence risks, and it will choose to hedge to diminish the risks brought by the high frequency.</p>
           <p>As p increases, the firm will be more sensitive to risks, and the lower part of the TypeI boundary will decreases more rapidly as the expected frequency increases. When p &gt; 4/3, the hedging districts in the right-upper corner and in the right-lower corner will merge when the expected frequency is large enough, which means that the firm will always choose to hedge when the expected frequency is large enough. When p &lt; 4/3, there will always be a room left for pooling no matter how larger the expected frequency will be.</p>
